# Front end for The Only Two DVDs They Have at the Front Desk at this Early Aughts Hotel (.com)

A humorous soltuion to analysis paralysis when browsing the myriad of options provided by streaming services. Users are sent to one of many hotels based on their timezone, and are provided two “DVD” options. Programmatically updates movie options every 2.5 days. Makes use of the Just Watch, and TMDb APIs to provide streaming links, and movie information. I also wrote my own simple API for the virtual hotels.
